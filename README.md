# jquery.SmoothScroll.js
A smooth scrolling plugin for jQuery.

## What it does
This simple jQuery plugin extends jQuery.
The new ´smoothScrollTop´ command makes the browser scroll to the specified element. This will then be a smooth transition.

## How it came into being
When developing our website, we needed a smooth scrolling plugin but none was working. That’s why we decided to develop our own jQuery plugin for that.
