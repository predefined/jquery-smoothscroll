jquery-smoothscroll.js
===================

A jQuery plugin for smooth page scrolling.

## What it does
SmoothScroll introduces the <code>smoothScrollTop</code> function that makes the browser smoothly scroll to the specified element.

## How to use
If you have a webpage you want to scroll on, simply add jQuery and the plugin to your references.
If you did that, simply get the element you want to scroll to and execute <code>smoothScrollTop();</code>.

## API

General usage:

    $(selector).smoothScrollTop([options]);
    
### Options

    The element to scroll on. Defaults to the selected element.
* parent: jQuery-Element

## How it came into being
When developing our own website we needed a smooth scrolling plugin. None of those we found was actually working. That's why we decided to develop our own jQuery plugin for that.
