jquery.smoothScroll.js
===================

A smooth scrolling plugin for jQuery.

## What it does
This simple jQuery plugin extends jQuery.
The new <code>smoothScrollTop</code> command makes the browser scroll to the specified element. This will then be a smooth transition.

## How to use

If you have a webpage you want to scroll on, simply add jQuery and the plugin to your references.
If you did that, simply get the element you want to scroll to and execute <code>smoothScrollTop();</code>.

Examples:
- If you want to scroll to the top of the page: <code>$("body").smoothScrollTop();</code>.
- If you want to scroll to the heading <code>#heading_1</code>: <code>$("#heading_1").smoothScrollTop();</code>.
- **For further options, consider the file itself.**

## How it came into being
When developing our website, we needed a smooth scrolling plugin but none was working. That's why we decided to develop our own jQuery plugin for that.
