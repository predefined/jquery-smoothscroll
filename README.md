jquery.smoothScroll.js
===================

A smooth scrolling plugin for jQuery.

## What it does
This simple jQuery plugin extends jQuery.
The new 'smoothScrollTop' command makes the browser scroll to the specified element. This will then be a smooth transition.

## How to use

If you have a webpage you want to scroll on, simply add jQuery and the plugin to your references.
If you did that, simply get the element you want to scroll to and execute 'smoothScrollTop();'.

Examples:
- If you want to scroll to the top of the page: '$("body").smoothScrollTop();'.
- If you want to scroll to the heading '#heading_1': '$("#heading_1").smoothScrollTop();'.
- **For further options, consider the file itself.**

## How it came into being
When developing our website, we needed a smooth scrolling plugin but none was working. That's why we decided to develop our own jQuery plugin for that.
